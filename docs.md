# Docs
**docs, sheets, slides, forms**

When you're lack of memory in real life as me, you must adapt yourself. So I'm 
a huge user of docs. To write some todo list, reminder, or tutorials, etc.   

I start to use notes on macOS, it was synchronised with my apple ecosystem but 
if all your devices aren't from apple this is a little bit more difficult.  

**Which alternatives ?**

+ Evernotes
    The app works everywhere (Android, IOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, webApp).
    You can collaborate on files, search function works into pdf files and some
    pictures, there is all the tools you need to edit a file properly.
    I used evernotes for several years as premium user until I switch to Notion 
    because for my usage, it was overkill to use evernotes.

+ Notion
    As evernotes it works on Android, IOS, Windows, macOS and there is a 
    webapp. It can replace your trello with his kanban section. You can add 
    users, even in free plan, to work together on some docs.

+ Simplenotes
    Compatibility : Everywhere (Android, IOS, Windows, macOS, Linux)   
    It was perfect, but you can't organise your docs in folders but by tags...
    You can't add pictures or files either. This is pure notes app. Evernotes 
    misses me. 

+ Notes (Nextcloud)
    Compatibility : Everywhere as a webapp.   
    I host myself the nextcloud instance, so for the privacy side I guess this 
    is the most advance solution. Your webdav link permit to import and 
    synchronized your notes with others applications compatible with 
    (as Joplin), if you don't like the native webapp (Notes). 
    As for simplenotes, you can't add pictures and files directly into Notes 
    and you can't access to your notes on your computer without any internet 
    connection (huge cons).


For collaborative works on sheets, I don't use those solutions but framasoft 
has developped [Framacalc](https://accueil.framacalc.org/fr/) and LibreOffice 
Calc.
There is exactly the same for docs: [Framapad](https://framapad.org/fr/) and
[LibreOffice](https://fr.libreoffice.org/).
