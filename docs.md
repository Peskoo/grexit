# Docs
** docs, sheets, slides, forms **

When you're lack of memory in real life as me, you must adapt yourself. So I'm 
a huge user of docs. To write some todo list, reminder, or tutorials, etc.   

I start to use notes on macOS, it was synchronised with my apple ecosystem but 
if all your devices as not a fruit this is a little bit more difficult.  

**Which alternatives ?**

+ Evernotes
    - The webapp works everywhere (Android, IOS, Windows, macOS, Linux) 
    contrariwise the desktop application.   
    I used evernotes for several years as premium user until I switch my 
    computer to linux where the application isn't compatible.  
    At the end, for my usage, it was overkill to use evernotes so I turn myself 
    to simplenotes.

+ Simplenotes
    - Compatibility : Everywhere (Android, IOS, Windows, macOS, Linux)   
    It was perfect, but you can't organise your docs in folders but by tags...
    You can't add pictures or files either. This is pure notes app. Evernotes 
    misses me. 

+ Notes (Nextcloud)
    - Compatibility : Everywhere as a webapp.   
    I host myself the nextcloud instance, so for the privacy side I guess this 
    is the most advance solution. Your webdav link permit to import and 
    synchronized your notes with others applications compatible with 
    (as Joplin), if you don't like the native webapp (Notes). 
    As for simplenotes, you can't add pictures and files directly into Notes 
    and you can't access to your notes on your computer without any internet 
    connection (huge cons).
