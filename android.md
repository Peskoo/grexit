# Android

I installed a fork from Android called: **Lineage OS**   

To replace Play Store:    
+ F-Droid
+ Aurora Store
+ Aptoide

You can download your favorite app like Spotify, Instagram or whatever on Aurora Store and Aptoide.    

**Cons:**    
You can say goodbye to some games which are synchronised with play store for payement in app. Like the latest Mario Kart.    
If the app is too much based on google services (like maps) it can't work properly.      
+ Apps using Google maps
   Like Uber, Kapten, or G7 (France), the apps doesn't work at all. I must call taxi centers like in 1995 to order a cab.      
   Otherwise Deliveroo works but the tracking part based on google maps doesn't work, I just can see where the delivery man is.     
   Citymappers works but I don't have maps :)   


**Pros:**    
I control a little bit more my datas.    
No google services in background, this is better for privacy and battery life.   
I'm using it on a One plus 3 (2016), and it works very well.
