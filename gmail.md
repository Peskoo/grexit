Here I will focus on webmail services. Easy to setup and secure !  
I live in Europe so most of those services will be GDPR compliant.

The only one I didn't test is *MailFence*, but there is some good reviews on his
security and his engagement with privacy.  
All the data will be collected and treated under GDPR, so no third parties without
any informations by the host.
