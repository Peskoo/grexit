This article is based on my personnal experience.    

I have realized few months ago that I used a lot of google services in my life.   
*Why* ? Mostly because it's free and well developped.   
Otherwise I wasn't aware of any alternatives solutions.


**Problems ?**    
First, some solutions aren't free.   
Then they are not sexiest as google.   


**Purposes ?**    
Even if you think that expose your datas everywhere has low impact in your life,  
this is a great way to favorise some alternatives which will be used in a country  
where freedom has more value.   


**My sins :**    
I still use Youtube because I've subscribed to a lot of channels and I support creators with adds.   
I still use google maps because I found nothing as good as gmaps and the gps application Waze (I'm trying Sygic).   
I have an Alexa Echo Spot (I'm working to replace it but It looks lovely).
