# Drive

I set up a [nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/install/#instructions-server) 
on my own server. The smartphone application is clear and with your storage 
there is a lot of applications as Notes, Calendar, Tasks, Contacts, and RSS. 
All in one place, and protect into your home sweet server.

There are many alternatives but I didn't tried those as:
+ [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
+ [Seafiles](https://www.seafile.com/en/home/)
+ [pCloud](https://www.pcloud.com/)
+ [Sugarsync](https://www.sugarsync.com/)
