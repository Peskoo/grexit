# Calendar

For me it was a little bit difficult to find an alternative as good as google 
calendar.  
Spoiler alert, I still didn't find this alternative.   

Which plateform could propose ?:   
+ Synchronization
+ **Good** user interface
+ Web interface
+ Easy to use

First, I tried [any.do](https://www.any.do/) with a premium plan. The interface 
and platforms avaibilities are great. But this is more a todo list than a 
calendar after all.  

So, I decided to drop the sexy for the usefull. Today I use the calendar of my 
[nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) server.  
This way I can just share the CalDav link with all the applications (desktop and 
mobile) which accepts these protocol (WebDav).


**Summary**:
+ NextCloud server
+ DAVx5 application on F-DROID store (mobile)
+ Etar (mobile)

Otherwise you can find alternatives with a [webmail](gmail.md) which contains
calendar feature.
